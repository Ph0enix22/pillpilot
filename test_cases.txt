COMPLEXITY VERIFICATION
========================

HashMap Operations (Tested in Test 3, 5, 11):
  - Insert: O(1) average - instant even with 100+ medicines
  - Search: O(1) average - ID lookup is immediate
  - Delete: O(1) average - removal doesn't scan all

Priority Queue (Tested in Test 4):
  - Auto-sorted output proves min-heap working
  - Insert: O(log n) - faster than full sort O(n log n)
  - Get min: O(1) - root is always earliest time

Linked List (Tested in Test 7, 9):
  - Insert at head: O(1) - newest entry appears first
  - Traversal: O(n) - displays all entries in order


KNOWN LIMITATIONS
=================
- Data is lost when program exits (no file saving yet)
- Hash table has fixed size of 100 entries
- Time input format is not validated
- History list keeps growing (no cleanup function)

TODO: Add file I/O for persistence
TODO: Add input validation
